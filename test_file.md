# what does this do?

## this is a test markdown

### this is for testing my capability to push to GitHub
#### this is a quaderary (?) heading ##### how about a fiftherary? ###### or a sexturary?

* first item (be sure to use spaces after asterisks)
* second (one hashtag makes a primary heading I guess)* third (text is just entered as text and ENTER isn't registered?) * fourth (do you need to hit enter between asterisks?)

like this, for example. I am now going to hit ENTER
and type more (enter)
and more
